# Re:Gear

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

### Installation

To use:
- git clone
- npm install
- npm run dev to start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code
