      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        At any given time, attics, basements, and closets across Ōtepoti are
        filled with music gear, cables—all kinds of electronics and devices
        gathering dust and falling into disrepair—ultimately destined for the
        landfill. re:Gear uses these materials to teach the mahi of repair and
        repurpose, hosting free workshops and drop-in sessions for the community
        to upskill, connect, and grow a diverse and accessible gear library.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        Whether you&apos;re tinkering for fun or working on something serious,
        re:GEAR has you covered.

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        All non-functioning donations are transformed from waste to educational
        resources, each an opportunity to learn how to diagnose simple faults,
        or research and investigate further. We also host meetups and workshops
        that feature unique do-dads, frankenstien&apos;d thingymabobs, and other
        noisemaking things created through the project.

      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        Repaired items become a community resource as we assemble and administer
        an accessible gear library, where musicians and music-enthusiasts can
        use our online database and to borrow, lend and exchange items.

        re:Gear is about building an inclusive, sustainable, and innovative
        community where resources are repaired and shared, not wasted.
